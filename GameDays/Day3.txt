 Today in your CSC151 lecture, the profesor asked you to team up with one of your classmates for a programming activity. Thankfully your bestie is in the class too, do you want to work with them? @Pictures/Day3.1.jpeg
Y I thought so. It's comforting to have someone you're familiar with. Bestfriend: I am glad we're on this together. We're out of time here, but did you want to talk about our plan tonight during dinner? @Pictures/Day3.2.jpeg
N In that case, you could work with someone else, it would be a chance to meet a new person. Here Hannah is not part of any group yet, you guys could be together. You introduced yourselves and talk a little about your expectations. Hannah is free to meet up later this afternoon, would you be okay with that? @Pictures/Day3.2.jpeg
YY Your other friends were at dinner too, and you didn't get the chance to really talk. The situation is bothering you especially that this needs to be done before next week. The good news is that everything could be solved with a good talk. Do you want to talk to your friend about this? @Pictures/Day3.3.jpeg
YN You: actually, I am afraid the dining halls are pretty loud and we won't be comfortable. Would you be okay with us meeting at Neilson? I could try to go in early and get us a booth or even one of those private rooms? The bestfriend: Absolutely! We could meet up this evening. I will see you there.... Your session was really good and you did get a lot done. I am looking at your schedule, you planned to go workout at the gym, Did you want to leave now? @Pictures/Day3.11.jpeg
NY Wonderful! Then you could both meet at Neilson and get a head start! @Pictures/Day3.4.jpeg#A1
NN Oh yeah it totally skipped my mind: you have to give a tour for Gold Key later let me look at your schedule to confirm. Oups looks like you double booked yourself for both a tour and a shift at the dining hall. I would assume you will go to the shift right? Get that $$ cash in. @Pictures/Day3.5.jpeg
YYY I am proud you went for that option. Thankfully, your friend was understanding and you both agreed to go somewhere quiet next time. @Pictures/Day3.6.jpeg#S1
YYN I understand that you don't want to cause a problem out of nothing. But the same thing happened again when you're friend suggested meeting in your house's living room and too many people were around. I am looking at your numbers now, you look stressed. Think about how fruitful a good talk would be. @Pictures/Day3.7.jpeg#M0
YNY Good choice! You have to keep up that work-life balance. The workout was really great and it felt good to move around and burn some steam. Keep up the good work! @Pictures/Day3.8.jpeg#P1
YNN Well, I guess you could stay finish up the project with your friend. But, you should totally get some rest later or go for a walk. Get yourself out of the classroom setting, you'll see how good it would be. @Pictures/Day3.11.jpeg#A1
NNY Fair enough. Just don't forget to send a message on Slack to the Gold Key people and apologize for not being able to show up. @Pictures/Day3.9.jpeg#M0
NNN I didn't expect that, but I am glad you are serious about your Gold Key membership. Here, I will help you out by emailing the dining hall channel on your behalf and ask other students to cover for you. Have fun at the tour! @Pictures/Day3.10.jpeg#M1
