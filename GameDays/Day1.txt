 Would you wanna live in King House? 
Y Wonderful! You got assigned the room 331. You have so much stuff to do. Do you wanna start unpacking now? 
N Yeah, who needs the loud quad, am I right? You got assigned to Cutter house. You miss your parents already though, do you wanna call them? 
YY Oh Well, this feels great. You look tired you could nap if you want to. Type Yes for me to understand. 
YN You ended up saying hi to your friends and you met Claire! She mentioned something about a party in the cloud though, do you want to go?
NY It feels great to talk to them, but you shouldn't be sad. Come on, let's get you into doing something, do you want to watch a movie?
NN You ended up taking a shower, and it was very refreshing. However, you don't have clean clothes to put on since you didn't unpack. Do you want to do that now? 
YYY That's what I thought. Well, have a good rest and see you tomorrow! 
YYN Well then I guess you could go to dinner. How about you do that, and I will see you tomorrow! 
YNY Ah it will be so great. I heard a lot of people talking about that too. I Bet you would have a great time. How about you go now, and I will see you tomorrow and you could fill me in! 
YNN Well in that case, I might suggest taking a look at your syllabus so you're well prepared for tomorrow. I will leave you to it... 
NYY Well then you should totally watch Interstellar, you love that! 
NYN Well in that case, I might suggest taking a look at your syllabus so you're well prepared for tomorrow. I will leave you to it... 
NNY You've got plenty to do then, I will leave you to it and get back to you tomorrow. Have a great rest of the day 
NNN Fair enough, you look tired. You should probably get dinner or nap for a bit. Unpacking can wait.
