 Ding Ding....Your alarm is ringing, do you want to wake up now? @Pictures/Day2.1.jpeg
Y Good choice! Now you can get showered, dressed, then get breakfast from the dining hall. On your way to class you met an old friend Fiona. Do you want to stop and talk to them since you have some time? @Pictures/Day2.2.jpeg
N Well then I Guess you could sleep for 5 more minut... Hold on! What time is it? Oh no! You overslept. You could still make it on time, were you thinking of having breakfast? @Pictures/Day2.3.jpeg
YY Fiona: Hi there! It's been so long oh my god! How was your summer, I am so glad to see you again. Did you have fun? @Pictures/Day2.4.jpeg
YN Well you could just wave at them and go to your class, I am sure that would be okay. Speaking of which have you decided on a major? I know you wanted to do Engineering, right? @Pictures/Day2.5.jpeg
NY In that case, you could stop at Tyler on your way to Ford.... Hold on, the lines are so long and you're kinda stuck here. Do you want to wait? You have 10 minutes before class. @Pictures/Day2.6.jpeg
NN Okay good you can leave now. Wait what's that. Your phone is ringing it's Sarah. They'll probably ask you to walk in together to class. Do you want to answer? @Pictures/Day2.7.jpeg
YYY You: Yeah, it felt good to be with my family and go to the beach. You know what I mean haha. Fiona: Well I am happy for you. Listen, my friend and I are going to Target later to run some errands. Do you want to come? @Pictures/Day2.4.jpeg
YYN Well you know, going in after college was pretty weird honestly. Everything felt different you know. Fiona: I am sorry about that. Well, now you're back! So where are you up to so early, do you have a class? @Pictures/Day2.4.jpeg
YNY Go off honestly! I am sure you'll do exceptionally well. Ahh! I am so excited for you, this semester will be a blast. My only advice is don't go too hard on yourself, and make sure you always have fun. I had a look at your schedule yesterday, it had 4 classes on it am I right? @Pictures/Day2.8.jpeg
YNN My bad! I do remember you saying that you wanted to switch to computer science, I forgot. But, it's still a great major with so many opportunities in the future. Have you told your parents about the decision? @Pictures/Day2.9.jpeg
NYY Well okay.. That would mean you'll show up late though because I doubt you'll get out of here before 10 minutes. If you don't want to make a bad impression on your first day, you could simply not show up at all. Do you want to do that? @Pictures/Day2.10.jpeg
NYN I understand. I am having a look at your percentages though and I can see that you're pretty hungry. I hope this doesn't affect your focus in class. @Pictures/Day2.11.jpeg
NNY Sarah: Hi !! How is it going? I don't feel like going to class today, I am still in my summer mood LOL. I will leave in a few and go swim in the lake, would you want to join? I can pick you up from your house. @Pictures/Day2.12.jpeg
NNN Okay you can hang up. I will use my robot super power and send them a text on your behalf saying that you accidently missed their call. @Pictures/Day2.13.jpeg#M0
YYYY You: Well I guess I could get some things for my room too and it would be a good chance to meet your friend. Listen, I have to run now, but I will see you later! @Pictures/Day2.14.jpeg#S1
YYYN You: Thank you for the invite, I really appreciate it. I promised a friend we'll go get some ice cream later, but I will see you around! @Pictures/Day2.15.jpeg#S1
YYNY Fiona: First day, am I right? Well in that case I don't want to hold you off. I will see you around! @Pictures/Day2.4.jpeg#S1
YYNN That's what I thought. Well it's a beautiful day so you could as well make the most out of it before homework kicks in. Speaking of which I gotta go meet the professor that I am TAing for, but it was wonderful seeing you! @Pictures/Day2.2.jpeg#S1
YNYY That's good. You'll be able to make a good work-life balance and go out with friends. Okay, I will leave you alone for now, we'll meet tomorrow and in the meantime, I will keep a look at your percentages and see how well you're doing. @Pictures/Day2.5.jpeg#M1
YNYN OH MAN you did it again didn't you? I knew you'd enroll in more than 4. As much as I like the enthusiasm, I do believe that you could chill now especially that you're on a good track major-wise. @Pictures/Day2.16.jpeg#M0
YNNY That's good, I am sure they were happy to learn that. I do remember your dad encouraging you to consider Computer Science the other day. @Pictures/Day2.17.jpeg#M1
YNNN There's no rush, just make sure you do so soon do you're all on the same page. @Pictures/Day2.5.jpeg#M1
NYYY That's fair. It's okay since it's the first day and people have probably not moved in yet, but in the future make sure you wake up early enough if you really want to get your breakfast. @Pictures/Day2.18.jpeg#M0
NYYN Well okay, but don't forget to apologize once you get into the class. And at least, don't bring the food with you. You could eat it on your way. @Pictures/Day2.19.jpeg#A0
NNYY You: You know what? I just woke up and I am also not feeling it. The lake escapade sounds good. Sarah: Fabulous, I will see you in a few. @Pictures/Day1.8.jpeg#A0
NNYN You: I am sorry queen, I really can't. I don't want to miss my first class. It's an engineering lecture and I really like the professor. But we can have fun on the weekend if you'd like.Sarah: No worries! I just wanted to check in with you. You should go then and I will see you later. @Pictures/Day2.19.jpeg#A1
